This software runs on every device, website and application you can think of. It is often created by volunteers, hobbyists and enthusiasts who selflessly dedicate their time and effort to the cause.</p><p>Utopian is building an open source economy, in which the people who make valuable contributions to open source software projects get rewarded for their hard work. Built ontop of the Steem blockchain, Utopian uses the wisdom of the crowd to reward valuable contributions. Project owners and other contributors all get to decide how rewards are distributed through voting or liking individual contributions, and they also have the option to support contributors directly by paying them in a cryptocurrency called STEEM, which can easily be traded for other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>"

These new tokens are distributed continuously to people performing actions deemed valuable by their communities through community voting. In the case of the Utopian community, as project owners, fellow contributors and other people with vested interests in open source software development \"upvote\" or \"like\" contributions, they have a say in how these new tokens are distributed, in direct relation to their stake in the Steem ecosystem (i.e. how much Steem Power they have).
